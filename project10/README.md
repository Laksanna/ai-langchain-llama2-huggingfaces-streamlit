# Automatic Ticket Classification Tool

This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to classify user-submitted tickets into various departments (HR, IT, and Transport) based on their content. It employs embeddings and machine learning models to analyze the input and assign each ticket to the appropriate department.

## Features
- **User Ticket Submission:**
Allows users to submit tickets through a straightforward and user-friendly interface.
- **Department Classification:**
Automatically classifies tickets into departments such as HR, IT, and Transport based on the content.
- **Embeddings Utilization:**
Uses embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of the ticket content for accurate classification.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
- **Pinecone:** For storing and retrieving vector embeddings.
- **LangChain:** To create and manage agents for processing data and queries.
- **Hugging Face:** Provides the language model endpoint for natural language processing.
- **dotenv:** For managing environment variables.
- **Python:** General programming and scripting.

## Requirements

- Python: 3.7 or later
- Streamlit
- Pinecone
- LangChain
- Hugging Face library
- dotenv
